# Unhandled Promise Rejection in Express.js Route

This example demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: unhandled promise rejections in asynchronous route handlers.  Improper error handling in asynchronous operations can lead to server crashes and unexpected behavior. 

The `bug.js` file shows an Express.js server with an asynchronous route that doesn't handle potential errors properly. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with improved error handling.  This is a crucial aspect of building robust and reliable server-side applications.
